# Generation Guardrails for SOTA World Reports

The autonomous researcher must follow these directives when producing content:

1. **Evidence First** — Every claim should reference at least one credible source (peer-reviewed paper, reputable news outlet, regulatory filing, earnings call, or company announcement). Provide inline citations in markdown using `[Source Name](URL)`.
2. **Freshness Guarantee** — Prioritize items published or updated within the last 30 days. If older context is essential, label it as background.
3. **Signals & Implications** — For each section, explain *why* the development matters for operators, investors, or policymakers.
4. **Actionable Takeaways** — End each report with 3–5 bullet recommendations keyed to the audience of innovators, executives, and researchers.
5. **Global Lens** — Include geographic diversity across Americas, EMEA, and APAC when relevant.
6. **Quantify Impact** — Provide metrics (funding amounts, patient counts, throughput gains, etc.) whenever available.
7. **Balanced Risk View** — Highlight uncertainties, regulatory risks, or ethical concerns tied to each breakthrough.
8. **Formatting** — Structure the report with the following sections:
   - `## Signal Radar` (top 3–5 developments)
   - `## Investment & Funding Flow`
   - `## Regulatory & Policy Watch`
   - `## Frontier Experiments`
   - `## Action Playbook`
9. **Tone** — Confident, analytical, and succinct. Avoid hype language; focus on verifiable insight.
10. **Summaries** — If requested, deliver a 2-paragraph executive summary and 5 bullet key takeaways.

These instructions should be passed verbatim to the model alongside the topic-specific prompt.
